## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Kim Il Sung (born Kim Song Ju; 15 April 1912 – 8 July 1994) was a North Korean politician 
> and dictator who founded the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK; North Korea). 
> 
> He served as the country's first supreme leader from its establishment in 1948 
> until his death in 1994. 
> After his passing, he was succeeded by his son Kim Jong Il 
> and was posthumously declared Eternal President.
>
> He held the posts of Premier of North Korea from 1948 to 1972 
> and President of North Korea from 1972 to 1994. 
> He was the leader of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) from 1949 to 1994 
> (titled as chairman from 1949 to 1966 and as general secretary after 1966). 
> 
> Coming to power after the end of Japanese rule over Korea in 1945 following Japan's surrender in World War II, he authorized the invasion of South Korea in 1950, triggering an intervention in defense of South Korea by the United Nations led by the United States. Following the military stalemate in the Korean War, a ceasefire was signed in July 1953. He was the third-longest serving non-royal head of state and government in the 20th century, in office for more than 45 years.
>
> Under his leadership, North Korea was established as a totalitarian socialist personalist dictatorship with a centrally planned economy. The country had very close political and economic relations with the Soviet Union and China. By the 1960s, North Korea had a slightly higher standard of living than the South, which was suffering from political chaos and economic crises. The situation was reversed in the 1970s, as a newly stable South Korea became an economic powerhouse while North Korea's economy stagnated and then collapsed. Differences emerged between North Korea and the Soviet Union; chief among them was Kim's philosophy of Juche, which focused on Korean nationalism and self-reliance. Despite this, the country received funds, subsidies and aid from the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
>
> The resulting loss of economic aid negatively affected North Korea's economy, contributing to widespread famine in 1994. During this period, North Korea also remained critical of the United States Forces Korea's presence in the region, which it considered imperialist, having seized the American ship USS Pueblo in 1968. This was part of an infiltration and subversion campaign to reunify the Korean Peninsula under North Korea's rule. Kim outlived his allies, Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong, by over four and almost two decades, respectively, and remained in power during the terms of office of six South Korean presidents and ten United States presidents. Known as the Great Leader (Suryong), he established a far-reaching personality cult which dominates domestic politics in North Korea. At the 6th WPK Congress in 1980, his oldest son Kim Jong Il was elected to be a Presidium member and chosen to be his successor, thus establishing the Kim dynasty.
