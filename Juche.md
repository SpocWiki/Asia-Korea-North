> **Juche**, officially the Juche idea, is a component of Kimilsungism–Kimjongilism, 
> the state ideology of North Korea and the official ideology of the Workers' Party of Korea. 
> 
> North Korean sources attribute its conceptualization to Kim Il Sung, 
> the country's founder and first leader. 
> 
> Juche was originally regarded as a variant of Marxism–Leninism until Kim Jong Il, 
> Kim Il Sung's son and successor, declared it a distinct ideology in the 1970s. 
> Kim Jong Il further developed Juche in the 1980s and 1990s 
> by making ideological breaks from Marxism–Leninism 
> and increasing the importance of his father's ideas.
>
> Juche incorporates the historical materialist ideas of Marxism–Leninism 
> but also strongly emphasizes the individual, the nation state, and national sovereignty. 
> 
> Juche posits that a country will prosper once it has become self-reliant by achieving political, economic, and military independence. As Kim Jong Il emerged as Kim Il Sung's likely successor in the 1970s, loyalty to the leader was increasingly emphasized as an essential part of Juche, as expressed in the Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System.
>
> Juche has been variously described by critics as a quasi-religion, a nationalist or fascistic ideology, and a deviation from Marxism–Leninism.
